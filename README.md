# Tetris AI

This GitHub repository houses a project that implements the classic game of Tetris and utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to play the game. The project aims to showcase the capabilities of AI algorithms in solving complex problems and achieving high scores in a popular video game.

Key Features:
- Tetris Implementation: The repository includes a complete implementation of the Tetris game, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the game. Players can control the movement and rotation of falling pieces to clear lines and earn points.

- AI Agent: The project incorporates an AI agent that is trained to play Tetris efficiently. The AI utilizes state-of-the-art techniques, such as reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms, to learn optimal strategies for placing Tetris pieces and maximizing the score. The AI agent continuously learns and adapts its gameplay based on feedback and rewards obtained during training.

<!-- - Game Analytics: The repository includes a comprehensive set of tools and utilities to analyze and visualize the gameplay data. Users can gain insights into the AI's decision-making process, observe its performance over time, and compare its strategies with human players. -->

<!-- - Customization and Extensibility: The codebase is designed to be easily customizable and extensible. Developers can experiment with different AI algorithms, modify the game rules, or enhance the visualization to suit their specific requirements. The repository provides clear documentation and guidelines to facilitate further development and contributions from the community. -->

<!-- - Demonstrations and Tutorials: The repository contains example scripts and tutorials that guide users through the process of training the AI agent and evaluating its performance. These resources aim to help users understand the underlying algorithms and encourage them to explore and innovate in the field of AI-driven gaming. -->

This project offers a solid foundation for building and experimenting with AI-powered gaming systems.
